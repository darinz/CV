# 07. Practical Considerations

When training machine learning models, practical considerations in regularization and optimization can make a significant difference in performance and stability. Here are key tips and best practices.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Learning Rate
- Start with $`\alpha = 0.001`$ for Adam
- Use a learning rate finder or grid search to determine the optimal range
- Monitor loss curves for instability (exploding/vanishing loss)

### Regularization Strength
- $`\lambda = 0.0001`$ to $`0.01`$ for L2 regularization
- Tune $`\lambda`$ using a validation set
- Consider dataset size and model complexity

### Momentum
- $`\mu = 0.9`$ for most problems
- Higher values (0.95–0.99) for fine-tuning
- Lower values (0.5–0.7) for initial training

## Monitoring Training

### Key Metrics
- Training and validation loss
- Learning rate schedule
- Gradient norms ($`\|\nabla L\|`$)
- Parameter norms

### Early Warning Signs
- **Exploding gradients:** $`\|\nabla L\| > 10`$
- **Vanishing gradients:** $`\|\nabla L\| < 10^{-6}`$
- **Oscillating loss:** Unstable learning rate

## Implementation Tips

1. **Gradient Clipping:** Prevents exploding gradients
   ```python
   grad_norm = np.linalg.norm(grad)
   max_norm = 5.0
   if grad_norm > max_norm:
       grad = grad * (max_norm / grad_norm)
   ```
2. **Weight Initialization:** Use schemes like Xavier or He initialization
3. **Batch Normalization:** Reduces need for aggressive regularization
4. **Data Augmentation:** Natural form of regularization for images
5. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models for better generalization

## Summary
- Tune hyperparameters using validation data
- Monitor training for early signs of instability
- Use best practices like gradient clipping and batch normalization
- Combine regularization and optimization techniques for robust models
