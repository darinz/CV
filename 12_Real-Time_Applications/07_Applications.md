# Applications of Real-Time Computer Vision

This guide explores real-world applications of real-time computer vision, with explanations, math, and Python code examples.

## 1. Autonomous Vehicles

### Real-time Detection
Safety requires fast detection of objects (cars, pedestrians, etc.).

```math
T_{detection} < 100 \text{ ms for safety}
```

#### Python Example: Real-Time Detection Loop
```python
import cv2
import time

def real_time_detection(model, video_source=0):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        start = time.time()
        detections = model(frame)
        latency = (time.time() - start) * 1000  # ms
        print(f"Detection latency: {latency:.2f} ms")
        # Draw detections, show frame, etc.
        if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
            break
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Multi-object Tracking
Track multiple objects simultaneously for navigation and safety.

```math
\text{Track } N \text{ objects simultaneously}
```

## 2. Surveillance Systems

### Motion Detection
Detects movement in video feeds for security.

```math
P(\text{motion}|I_t) = \sigma(f_{motion}(I_t))
```

#### Python Example: Motion Detection Alert
```python
motion_mask, score = detect_motion(frame, prev_frame)
if score > 0.05:
    print("Motion detected!")
```

### Object Tracking Across Cameras
Track objects as they move between different camera views.

## 3. Mobile Applications (AR/VR)

### AR/VR Rendering
Low-latency rendering is critical for immersive experiences.

```math
T_{rendering} < 16.67 \text{ ms for 60 FPS}
```

#### Python Example: Frame Timing for AR
```python
import time
start = time.time()
# ... render AR frame ...
latency = (time.time() - start) * 1000
if latency > 16.67:
    print("Warning: Frame too slow for 60 FPS")
```

### Real-time Image Recognition
Recognize objects in camera feed instantly.

## 4. IoT Devices

### Smart Cameras
Process video locally, send alerts to cloud only when needed.

#### Python Example: Local Processing
```python
def process_and_alert(frame):
    if detect_event(frame):
        send_alert()
```

### Edge Analytics
Reduce cloud dependency by analyzing data on-device.

## Summary
- Real-time vision powers safety in vehicles, security in surveillance, immersive AR/VR, and smart IoT devices.
- Python code and math help implement and understand these applications.
