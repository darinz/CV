# Applications of Robot Learning

Robot learning enables a wide range of real-world applications. This guide covers key areas, with explanations and Python code examples where possible.

## 1. Autonomous Navigation

Robots learn to navigate complex environments using sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar) and learning-based control.

**Key Concepts:**
- Perception: Mapping sensor data to environment understanding
- Planning: Finding paths to goals
- Control: Executing safe, efficient movements

**Python Example (Path Planning with A*):**
```python
import heapq

def astar(start, goal, neighbors_fn, heuristic_fn):
    open_set = [(0 + heuristic_fn(start, goal), 0, start, [])]
    visited = set()
    while open_set:
        est_total, cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(open_set)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        path = path + [node]
        if node == goal:
            return path
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in neighbors_fn(node):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(open_set, (cost + 1 + heuristic_fn(neighbor, goal), cost + 1, neighbor, path))
    return None

def neighbors_fn(node):
    # Example: 4-connected grid
    x, y = node
    return [(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)]

def heuristic_fn(a, b):
    return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])

path = astar((0,0), (3,3), neighbors_fn, heuristic_fn)
print("Path:", path)
```

## 2. Industrial Automation

Robots automate repetitive or dangerous tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and more.

**Key Concepts:**
- Precision and repeatability
- Learning from demonstration for flexible automation
- Safety and reliability

**Python Example (Task Scheduling):**
```python
tasks = ["pick", "place", "inspect", "assemble"]
for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
    print(f"Step {i+1}: {task}")
```

## 3. Assistive Robotics

Robots assist humans in healthcare, homes, and public spaces.

**Key Concepts:**
- Human-robot interaction
- Learning user preferences
- Safe and adaptive behavior

**Python Example (Simple Preference Learning):**
```python
import numpy as np
# User feedback: +1 (like), -1 (dislike)
feedback = [1, -1, 1, 1, -1]
preference = np.sign(np.sum(feedback))
if preference > 0:
    print("User prefers option A")
else:
    print("User prefers option B")
```

## 4. Dexterous Manipulation

Robots perform complex object manipulation, such as assembly or tool use.

**Key Concepts:**
- Multi-fingered hands
- Tactile sensing
- Learning fine motor skills

**Python Example (Grasp Planning Skeleton):**
```python
def plan_grasp(object_pose, hand_model):
    # Placeholder: select grasp based on object pose
    return "grasp_pose"

object_pose = [0.5, 0.2, 0.1]
hand_model = "robot_hand"
grasp = plan_grasp(object_pose, hand_model)
print("Planned grasp:", grasp)
```

## 5. Human-Robot Interaction

Robots interact and collaborate with humans in shared environments.

**Key Concepts:**
- Perception of human actions and intent
- Learning from human feedback
- Safe, transparent decision-making

**Python Example (Human Feedback Loop):**
```python
def robot_action(state):
    # Placeholder for robot policy
    return "move_forward"

def get_human_feedback():
    # Simulate human feedback
    return "good"

state = "waiting"
action = robot_action(state)
feedback = get_human_feedback()
print(f"Robot action: {action}, Human feedback: {feedback}")
```

## Summary

Robot learning powers applications from navigation to human-robot collaboration, enabling robots to operate autonomously and adaptively in the real world.
