# Robot Learning

Robot learning combines machine learning with robotics to enable autonomous agents to perceive, plan, and act in complex environments. This field leverages deep learning, reinforcement learning, and model-based approaches for perception, control, and manipulation.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)

Deep RL enables robots to learn control policies from high-dimensional sensory inputs (e.g., images, proprioception) through trial and error.

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A robot's environment is modeled as an MDP $`(S, A, P, R, \gamma)`$:
- $`S`$: State space
- $`A`$: Action space
- $`P(s'|s,a)`$: Transition probability
- $`R(s,a)`$: Reward function
- $`\gamma`$: Discount factor

### Policy and Value Functions
- **Policy:** $`\pi(a|s)`$ gives the probability of taking action $`a`$ in state $`s`$.
- **State Value:**
```math
V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \mid s_0 = s \right]
```
- **Action Value:**
```math
Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a \right]
```

### Deep Q-Learning
- Approximates $`Q(s,a)`$ with a neural network $`Q_\theta(s,a)`$.
- **Update Rule:**
```math
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \left( Q_\theta(s,a) - y \right)^2
```
where $`y = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_\theta(s', a')`$.

### Policy Gradient Methods
- Directly optimize the policy $`\pi_\theta(a|s)`$.
- **REINFORCE Gradient:**
```math
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \left[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^{\pi}(s,a) \right]
```

### Actor-Critic Methods
- **Actor:** Learns the policy $`\pi_\theta(a|s)`$.
- **Critic:** Learns the value function $`V_\phi(s)`$ or $`Q_\phi(s,a)`$.

## Model Learning

Model learning involves learning a predictive model of the robot's environment or dynamics.

### Dynamics Model
Learn $`\hat{f}_\theta(s, a) \approx s'`$:
```math
s' = f(s, a) \approx \hat{f}_\theta(s, a)
```

### Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
- Use the learned model $`\hat{f}_\theta`$ for planning or policy improvement.
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC):**
  - At each step, solve:
```math
\max_{a_{0:H-1}} \sum_{t=0}^{H-1} R(s_t, a_t)
```
  - Subject to $`s_{t+1} = \hat{f}_\theta(s_t, a_t)`$.

### World Models
- Learn compact latent representations of the environment.
- Use latent dynamics for planning and imagination-based RL.

## Robotic Manipulation

Robotic manipulation focuses on controlling robot arms or hands to interact with objects.

### Grasping
- Predict grasp points or poses from sensory input.
- **Grasp Quality Metric:**
```math
Q_{grasp} = f_{\text{grasp}}(s, o)
```
where $`s`$ is the state and $`o`$ is the object.

### Imitation Learning
- Learn manipulation skills from demonstrations.
- **Behavioral Cloning:**
```math
\min_\theta \sum_{i} \| \pi_\theta(s_i) - a_i \|^2
```

### Visual Servoing
- Use visual feedback to control the robot.
- **Control Law:**
```math
a_t = f_{\text{servo}}(I_t, s_t)
```
where $`I_t`$ is the image at time $`t`$.

### Reinforcement Learning for Manipulation
- Learn end-to-end policies for tasks like pick-and-place, stacking, or tool use.

## Applications
- Autonomous navigation
- Industrial automation
- Assistive robotics
- Dexterous manipulation
- Human-robot interaction

## Summary

Robot learning integrates deep RL, model-based learning, and manipulation to enable robots to autonomously acquire complex skills in dynamic, real-world environments. Advances in perception, control, and learning algorithms continue to expand the capabilities of intelligent robots.
