# Advanced Techniques in Distributed Training

Advanced techniques enable efficient training of extremely large models (billions of parameters) across many devices.

## ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)

- Splits optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across devices to reduce memory usage.

**Stages:**
- Stage 1: Partition optimizer states
- Stage 2: Partition gradients
- Stage 3: Partition parameters

**Math:**
$$
\text{Memory Reduction} = \frac{1}{N}
$$
where $N$ is the number of devices.

**Python Example (DeepSpeed):**
```python
import deepspeed
model, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(model=model, optimizer=optimizer, config=ds_config)
```

## Megatron-LM

- Uses tensor and pipeline model parallelism for large transformer models.

**Column Parallel:**
$$
Y = [Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_N] = [XW_1, XW_2, \ldots, XW_N]
$$

**Row Parallel:**
$$
Y = X_1W_1 + X_2W_2 + \ldots + X_NW_N
$$

## DeepSpeed

- Library for memory-efficient, high-performance distributed training.
- Supports ZeRO, gradient accumulation, and communication optimization.

**Math:**
$$
\text{Peak Memory} = \frac{\text{model\_size} + \text{optimizer\_size}}{N}
$$
