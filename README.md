Deep learning has fundamentally transformed computer vision, enabling machines to perceive and understand visual information with unprecedented accuracy. Computer vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications spanning search engines, image understanding systems, mobile applications, mapping services, medical imaging, drone technology, and autonomous vehicles. From recognizing objects in images to understanding complex scenes in videos, deep learning models have achieved human-level performance on many visual tasks.

Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization, and object detection. Recent developments in neural network approaches (commonly known as "deep learning") have dramatically advanced the performance of state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This revolution has been driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms, and generative models, opening new possibilities in autonomous systems, healthcare, entertainment, and beyond.

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive curriculum for deep learning in computer vision, covering fundamental concepts to advanced applications. The curriculum is structured to take you from basic linear classifiers through state-of-the-art architectures like Vision Transformers and diffusion models.

This curriculum is a deep dive into the details of deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for visual recognition tasks, particularly image classification. The learning journey begins with foundational concepts including linear classifiers, neural networks, and backpropagation. You'll then explore convolutional neural networks and their evolution through architectures like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet. The curriculum advances to modern techniques including attention mechanisms, transformers, and self-supervised learning.

Practical applications are emphasized throughout, with hands-on experience in image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and video understanding. You'll also explore cutting-edge areas like generative models (VAEs, GANs, diffusion models), 3D vision, vision-language models, and robotic learning.

The curriculum balances theoretical understanding with practical implementation, ensuring you can both understand the underlying principles and build working systems. Through structured modules and real-world projects, you'll develop the skills needed to tackle current and future challenges in computer vision.
